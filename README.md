# ðŸŒ¿ A Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Decision Tree for Recognition of Medicinal Plants Leaves

This project presents a comparative study between **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Decision Tree classifiers** for the recognition of Indian medicinal plant leaves. It aims to evaluate and analyze the performance of both models on image classification tasks using a publicly available dataset.


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

ðŸ”— **[Indian Medicinal Leaves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/indian-medicinal-leaves-dataset)**
